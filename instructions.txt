1. download zip from github
2. npm install to install all of the packages
3. Open up compass and create a database labeled "Users", and lable the collection "usermanagers"
4.(optional) You can upload OurMongoArray.json to the usermanagers collection so when you run "npm start" in 
    the terminal it has a database to play with. Or just run the app and take time to add your own users.
5. You can add users with the add user button.
6. search by first or last name
7. edit and delete existing users. 

Thank you.
